# Developing an SRS-Based Intelligent Tutoring System

### Introduction

Through this project a working prototype of a language learning application that implements best practices in language learning along with an intelligent tutoring system (to maximize learning effectiveness) was developed. Prior to the development of this prototype the author was unable to find existing language learning applications that implemented intelligent tutoring systems.

The original goal of this project was to develop a language learning tool that implemented both an intelligent tutoring system and best practices from game-based learning (gamification).
